In INLA we fit fixed effect as factor (ward_code) and random effect as integer (ward_codeI) 


Intsructions from Gregor (Accuracy of prediction in INLA)

I remembered one cool way to do phenotype predictions and hence validation with INLA R package. If you set a phenotype to NA and keep that record in the data, then INLA creates a predictive distribution for that phenotype based on the model and all itâ€™s parameters, including fixed effects and random effects. This means that we do not need to worry about pre-correcting phenotypes to then correlate them with estimated breeding values - we can do estimation of fixed and random effects and these effects are then used to predict the missing phenotype - we can then do two things:
1.	Correlate posterior mean for the phenotype prediction for those records that we have set to NA
2.	Calculate how well the posterior predictive distribution of the with-held phenotype overlaps with the observed phenotype (CRPS metric)
The above is a much cleaner way to do validation.One important point is to figure out what are good validation scenarios! Clearly removing just one record of a cow out of many, will not be the same as removing all records of a cow, which also will not be the same as removing all records of a herd, which will not be the same as removing all records of a village or ward! There are two-three actions for you @Isidore Houaga here:

1.	Check how setting a phenotype value to  NA  gives you a prediction - explore the structure of the INLA output - there is a lot of things in there - the object is a huge list of lists of lists etc. See also the documentation - let me know if you get lost!
2.	Think about good/interesting validation scenarios - scribble them here and we can discuss
3.	Think how to implement these different validation scenarios in R code
