This folder "Scripts_Manuscript_Spatial_modelling_AADGG" contains the R codes used to generate the results in the manuscript "Spatial modelling improves genomic evaluation in Tanzanian smallholder admixed dairy cattle".
There are three files: 1) Scripts_Spatial_Modelling.R, 2) Scripts_Model_Validation.R and 3) Scripts_PCA_Correlations.R

1) "Scripts_Spatial_Modelling.R": This file contains the code used to generate the mesh, model definition and model fitting.
   
2) "Scripts_Model_Validation.R": This file contains the code used for cross-validation and forward validation of the models
   
3) "Scripts_PCA_Correlations.R": This file contains the code used for Principal components Analysis, Multi-variate analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and the correlation between estimated genomic breeding values and models components.
